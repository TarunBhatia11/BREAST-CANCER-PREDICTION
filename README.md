## Introduction

Breast cancer classification is a critical task in the medical field, helping in early detection and treatment planning. This repository provides a comprehensive workflow to classify breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that accurately classifies breast cancer as malignant (M) or benign (B) based on various features from breast cancer test data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains features extracted from breast cancer test results, such as:
- Radius
- Texture
- Perimeter
- Area
- Smoothness
- Compactness
- Concavity
- Concave points
- Symmetry
- Fractal dimension
- And more...

The dataset is available in the `data` directory.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TarunBhatia11/breast-cancer-classifier.git
cd breast-cancer-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.

## Usage

To run the analysis and model training, follow these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize numerical features.

    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```

2. **Model Training:** Train the model using the preprocessed data.

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

3. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

    ```bash
    python predict.py --input new_data.csv --output predictions.csv
    ```

## Model

We explore several machine learning models, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gradient Boosting

The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

The results of the model training and evaluation are stored in the `results` directory. This includes:

- Evaluation metrics
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve
- Feature importance
